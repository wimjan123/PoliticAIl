**Author:** Claude Code Research Agent

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis evaluates 9 engine and framework options for building a political desktop OS simulation that requires advanced windowing capabilities, real-time data visualization, and modern UI features. After extensive technical and market research, **Tauri + Web Stack** emerges as the primary recommendation, with **Flutter Desktop** as the strategic fallback option.

The analysis reveals that traditional game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot) are over-engineered for desktop OS simulation requirements, while native frameworks (Qt/QML, Avalonia) offer excellent capabilities but require specialized expertise. Modern hybrid approaches (Tauri, Flutter) provide the optimal balance of development velocity, windowing capabilities, and deployment flexibility.
