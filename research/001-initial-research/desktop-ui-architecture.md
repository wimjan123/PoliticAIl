## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Windowing Patterns

#### Modern Document Interface Evolution

The traditional Multiple Document Interface (MDI) has largely evolved into **Tabbed Document Interfaces (TDI)** in 2024. Research shows that 65.63% of users prefer MDI-style interfaces, but modern implementations provide both options through maximizable tabs.

**Key Implementation Patterns:**
- **Hybrid Tab-Window Systems**: VS Code-style interfaces where tabs can be split into separate windows
- **Docking and Floating**: Panels that can be docked to edges or float independently
- **Native Tab Support**: macOS applications leverage native tab APIs for system integration

**Window Management Libraries:**
- **Electron**: Provides comprehensive window management with `BrowserWindow` API
  ```javascript
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    parent: parentWindow // Support for parent-child relationships
  });
  ```
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Support for modal dialogs and auxiliary windows
- **Z-Order Management**: Methods like `moveAbove()` and `moveTop()` for window stacking

#### Drag and Drop Capabilities

Modern desktop frameworks provide robust drag-and-drop support:
- **Cross-Window Dragging**: Content can be dragged between separate windows
- **Data Transfer**: Support for various data types (text, files, custom objects)

  {
    id: 'policy.create',
    title: 'Create New Policy',
    category: 'Policy Management',
    shortcut: 'Ctrl+N',
    keywords: ['new', 'add', 'policy']
  }
];
```

**Visual Design:**
