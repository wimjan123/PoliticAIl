  const newsEvent = req.body;

  // Process political relevance
  const relevanceScore = calculatePoliticalRelevance(newsEvent);

  if (relevanceScore > GAME_THRESHOLD) {
    // Trigger game event
    gameEventManager.processNewsEvent(newsEvent, relevanceScore);
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

**Polling Fallback Strategy:**
- Primary: Webhook-based real-time updates

- Historical data analysis
- Bulk content categorization

### 4. GAME INTEGRATION DESIGN

#### Political Relevance Scoring Algorithm

**Multi-factor Scoring Model:**
```python
def calculate_political_relevance(article):
    scores = {
        'keyword_match': analyze_political_keywords(article.content),
        'source_authority': get_source_credibility(article.source),
        'topic_category': categorize_political_topic(article.content),
        'geographic_relevance': assess_geographic_impact(article.location),
        'temporal_urgency': calculate_breaking_news_score(article.published_at)
    }

    # Weighted combination
    relevance = (
        scores['keyword_match'] * 0.3 +
        scores['source_authority'] * 0.2 +
        scores['topic_category'] * 0.25 +
        scores['geographic_relevance'] * 0.15 +
        scores['temporal_urgency'] * 0.1
    )

    return min(relevance, 1.0)
```

#### Temporal Decay Implementation

**Three Decay Function Types:**

1. **Linear Decay**: Constant relevance decrease over time
```python
def linear_decay(hours_elapsed, max_hours=168):  # 1 week
    return max(0, 1 - (hours_elapsed / max_hours))
```

2. **Exponential Decay**: Rapid initial decline, slower long-term
```python
def exponential_decay(hours_elapsed, half_life=24):
    return math.exp(-0.693 * hours_elapsed / half_life)
```

3. **Gaussian Decay**: Smooth bell-curve relevance
```python
def gaussian_decay(hours_elapsed, peak_hours=6, std_dev=12):
    return math.exp(-0.5 * ((hours_elapsed - peak_hours) / std_dev) ** 2)
```

#### Game Event Mapping Framework

**News Category to Game Impact:**
- **Economic Policy**: Market volatility, tax changes, employment effects
- **Foreign Relations**: Trade agreements, diplomatic relations, military actions
- **Domestic Politics**: Election campaigns, policy announcements, scandal management
- **Social Issues**: Public opinion shifts, protest movements, demographic changes
- **Environmental**: Climate policy, natural disasters, resource management

#### Emergency/Breaking News Handling

**Breaking News Detection Criteria:**
1. Source velocity (multiple outlets reporting simultaneously)
2. Social media engagement spikes
3. Government/official source announcements
4. Keyword urgency indicators ("breaking", "urgent", "emergency")

**Game Response Mechanisms:**
- Immediate notification to active players
- Accelerated game clock for urgent decisions
- Special event scenarios triggered
- Advisor AI provides context and recommendations

### 5. FALLBACK STRATEGIES

#### Graceful Degradation Architecture

1. **Primary**: Real-time API feeds with webhook delivery
2. **Secondary**: Cached content from last 48 hours
3. **Tertiary**: Pre-populated historical news database
4. **Quaternary**: Synthetic news generation based on political templates

#### Synthetic News Generation for Backup

**Procedural Content Generation Framework:**
```python
class SyntheticNewsGenerator:
    def __init__(self, political_context):
        self.context = political_context
        self.templates = load_news_templates()
        self.fact_tables = load_political_facts()

    def generate_political_event(self, category, urgency_level):
        template = self.select_template(category, urgency_level)
        facts = self.context.get_relevant_facts(category)

        # Three-step process: modify fact, update table, apply to article
        modified_fact = self.modify_single_fact(facts)
        updated_table = self.update_fact_table(facts, modified_fact)
        article = self.generate_article(template, updated_table)

        return article
```

**Synthetic Content Categories:**
- Economic announcements (GDP, unemployment, inflation)
- Political appointments and resignations
- Legislative proposal introductions
- Diplomatic meeting outcomes
- Public opinion poll releases

#### Local Caching and Persistence

**Caching Strategy Implementation:**
```python
# Multi-layer caching architecture
class NewsCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory_cache = {}  # Redis for immediate access
        self.disk_cache = {}    # Local SSD for 24-hour retention
        self.archive_db = {}    # MongoDB for historical analysis

    def get_news(self, query_params):
        # Check memory cache first (sub-millisecond)
        if cached := self.memory_cache.get(query_params):
            return cached

        # Check disk cache (millisecond response)
        if cached := self.disk_cache.get(query_params):
            self.memory_cache[query_params] = cached
            return cached

        # Fallback to archive database
        return self.archive_db.query(query_params)
```

### 6. CONTENT FILTERING

#### Political Bias Detection and Balancing

**MBFC Integration for Bias Assessment:**
```python
def assess_news_bias(article_source):
    mbfc_data = mbfc_api.get_source_rating(article_source)

    return {
        'bias_rating': mbfc_data.get('bias'),  # left, center, right, etc.
        'factual_reporting': mbfc_data.get('factual'),
        'credibility_score': mbfc_data.get('trust_score'),
        'warning_flags': mbfc_data.get('warnings', [])
    }

def balance_news_feed(articles):
    """Ensure political balance across news sources"""
    bias_counts = defaultdict(int)
    balanced_feed = []

    for article in articles:
        bias = assess_news_bias(article.source)

        # Limit articles from heavily biased sources
        if bias_counts[bias['bias_rating']] < MAX_PER_BIAS:
            balanced_feed.append(article)
            bias_counts[bias['bias_rating']] += 1

    return balanced_feed
```

        while True:
            # Get news from queue
            news_item = await self.redis_queue.blpop('news_queue')

            # Parallel processing
            await asyncio.gather(
                self.extract_political_keywords(news_item),
                self.assess_bias_and_credibility(news_item),
                self.calculate_game_relevance(news_item),
                self.store_in_databases(news_item),
                self.trigger_game_events(news_item)
            )

    async def store_in_databases(self, news_item):
        """Dual storage in MongoDB and Elasticsearch"""
        # Primary storage in MongoDB
        mongo_doc = await self.mongodb.news.insert_one(news_item)

        # Search indexing in Elasticsearch
        await self.elasticsearch.index(
            index='news',
