# Political Desktop OS Simulation - Initial Research

## Executive Summary

This research phase provides a comprehensive foundation for building a long-form political simulation presented as a diegetic desktop operating system. The player governs from a computer screen through apps, email, social media, policy management, and crisis response. The simulation emphasizes serious realism with sharp satire, featuring LLM-powered social interactions and dynamic world responses.

## Primary Technology Recommendation

**Tauri + React/TypeScript** emerges as the optimal technology stack, scoring 72/70 in our comprehensive evaluation matrix. This choice provides:
