## Core Components

### 1. AI Decision Engine (`AIDecisionEngine`)

The core decision-making system that:
- Analyzes political situations
- Generates possible actions based on personality
- Weights options by strategic value
- Selects optimal actions with unpredictability factors

```typescript
const decisionEngine = new AIDecisionEngine(politician, 'progressive');
const decision = await decisionEngine.makeDecision(context);
```

### 2. Relationship Manager (`RelationshipManager`)

Manages dynamic relationships between politicians:
- Tracks relationship scores (-100 to +100)
- Records relationship-changing events
- Processes policy agreements/disagreements
- Applies time-based relationship decay

```typescript
const relationshipManager = new RelationshipManager();
relationshipManager.processPolicyStance(politician1, politician2, policy, true);
```

### 3. Event Response System (`EventResponseSystem`)

Handles AI responses to political events:
- Generates personality-appropriate responses
- Supports coordinated responses between allies
- Tracks response patterns for consistency
- Adapts to different event types (crisis, scandal, opportunity, election)

```typescript
const responseSystem = new EventResponseSystem(relationshipManager);
const response = responseSystem.generateEventResponse(politician, event, context, archetype);
```

### 4. Consistency Validator (`AIConsistencyValidator`)

Validates AI behavior consistency:
- Tests personality trait consistency
- Monitors decision pattern stability
- Detects behavioral drift
- Provides performance assessments

```typescript
const validator = new AIConsistencyValidator(decisionEngine, responseSystem, relationshipManager);
const assessment = await validator.validateAIConsistency(politician, 50);
```

### 5. AI Orchestrator (`AIOrchestrater`)

Central coordination system:
- Manages all AI politicians
- Processes simulation ticks
- Coordinates between systems
- Provides unified API

```typescript
const orchestrator = new AIOrchestrater();
const aiPolitician = orchestrator.initializeAIPolitician(politician, 'progressive');
const tickResult = await orchestrator.processSimulationTick(context, events);
```

## Personality System

The system includes 5 distinct personality archetypes:

### 1. Progressive Activist
- **Focus**: Social justice, environmental protection, systemic reform
- **Traits**: High social justice focus (95%), reform preference (90%), coalition building (85%)
- **Behavior**: Pushes progressive agenda, organizes coalitions, challenges establishment

### 2. Conservative Traditionalist
- **Focus**: Stability, tradition, gradual change through institutions
- **Traits**: High stability preference (90%), low reform preference (20%), moderate collaboration (60%)
- **Behavior**: Maintains status quo, incremental reforms, institutional approach

### 3. Pragmatic Centrist
- **Focus**: Compromise, evidence-based solutions, practical governance
- **Traits**: High collaboration (90%), compromise willingness (85%), data reliance (85%)
- **Behavior**: Seeks bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policies, broad coalitions

### 4. Populist Outsider
- **Focus**: Anti-establishment, direct public appeal, disruptive politics
- **Traits**: High populism (95%), anti-establishment (95%), media savviness (85%)
- **Behavior**: Direct public appeals, anti-elite messaging, disruptive tactics

### 5. Technocratic Expert
- **Focus**: Expertise, data-driven decisions, systematic approaches
- **Traits**: High data reliance (95%), stability preference (75%), low populism (20%)
- **Behavior**: Expert consultation, systematic solutions, competence-focused

### Personality Traits

Each archetype has the following traits (0-100 scale):

- `risk_tolerance`: Willingness to take political risks
- `collaboration_preference`: Preference for working with others
- `compromise_willingness`: Willingness to compromise on positions
- `populism_tendency`: Focus on public opinion vs personal conviction
- `reform_preference`: Preference for gradual vs radical change
- `unpredictability`: Randomness factor in decision-making
- `social_justice_focus`: Focus on social justice issues
- `stability_preference`: Preference for stability over change
- `data_reliance`: Reliance on data vs intuition
- `anti_establishment`: Anti-establishment sentiment
- `public_opinion_weight`: Focus on public opinion vs expert advice
- `coalition_building`: Preference for coalition building
- `media_savviness`: Tendency to take media-friendly positions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { AIOrchestrater, PERSONALITY_ARCHETYPES } from './ai';

// Create AI system
const orchestrator = new AIOrchestrater();

// Initialize AI politician
const politician = createPolitician(); // Your politician data
const aiPolitician = orchestrator.initializeAIPolitician(
  politician,
  'progressive',
  15 // Personality variation
);

// Process simulation tick
const context = {
  climate: getCurrentClimate(),
  all_politicians: getAllPoliticians(),
  active_policies: getActivePolicies(),
  urgency: 50
};

const events = getCurrentEvents();
const result = await orchestrator.processSimulationTick(context, events);
```

### Custom Personality Traits

```typescript
import { generatePersonalityVariation } from './ai';

// Generate variant of progressive archetype
const customTraits = generatePersonalityVariation('progressive', 20);

// Or create completely custom traits
const customTraits = {
  risk_tolerance: 80,
  collaboration_preference: 60,
  compromise_willingness: 40,
  // ... other traits
};

const aiPolitician = orchestrator.initializeAIPolitician(
  politician,
  'progressive',
  customTraits
);
```

### Relationship Analysis

```typescript
// Get relationship between two politicians
const relationship = orchestrator.getRelationshipManager()
  .getRelationship(politician1.id, politician2.id);

// Process policy stance impact
orchestrator.getRelationshipManager()
  .processPolicyStance(politician1, politician2, policy, true, true);

// Get all relationships for a politician
const relationships = orchestrator.getRelationshipManager()
  .getPoliticianRelationships(politician.id);
```

### Event Response Testing

```typescript
// Generate response to event
const response = orchestrator.getResponseSystem()
  .generateEventResponse(politician, event, context, archetype);

// Analyze response patterns
const patterns = orchestrator.getResponseSystem()
  .analyzeResponsePatterns(politician.id);
```

### Consistency Validation

```typescript
// Validate AI consistency
const assessment = await orchestrator.getConsistencyValidator()
  .validateAIConsistency(politician, 50);

console.log(`Consistency Score: ${assessment.overall_consistency}%`);
console.log(`Test Results: ${assessment.test_results.length} tests`);

// Check individual test results
assessment.test_results.forEach(test => {
  console.log(`${test.test_name}: ${test.passed ? 'PASS' : 'FAIL'} (${test.score}%)`);
});
```

## Performance

### Benchmarks

Based on test results with 5 AI politicians over 25 ticks:

- **Decision Making**: ~10-50ms per decision
- **Relationship Updates**: ~1-5ms per relationship
- **Event Processing**: ~20-100ms per event
- **Consistency Validation**: ~100-500ms per politician
- **Simulation Tick**: ~50-200ms total

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple decisions/events together
2. **Caching**: Cache personality compatibility calculations
3. **History Limits**: Limit decision/relationship history size
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load relationships and patterns on demand
5. **Async Processing**: Use async/await for long operations

### Memory Usage

- **AI Politicians**: ~50KB per politician (including history)
- **Relationships**: ~5KB per relationship
- **Decision History**: ~1KB per decision
- **Response History**: ~2KB per response

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Low Consistency Scores

**Problem**: AI politicians showing inconsistent behavior patterns.

**Solutions**:
- Check personality trait implementation in decision logic
- Adjust decision weights for trait alignment
- Review unpredictability settings
- Validate decision context data

#### Poor Relationship Evolution

**Problem**: Relationships not changing appropriately over time.

**Solutions**:
- Verify policy stance processing
- Check relationship event recording
- Adjust decay rates
- Review compatibility calculations

#### Inappropriate Event Responses

**Problem**: AI responses don't match personality or context.

**Solutions**:
- Review response template conditions
- Check archetype response patterns
- Verify event type categorization
- Adjust personality requirements

#### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow simulation tick processing.

**Solutions**:
- Reduce decision history limits
- Optimize relationship queries
- Batch similar operations
- Profile decision-making bottlenecks

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging:

```typescript
// Log decision reasoning
const decision = await decisionEngine.makeDecision(context);
console.log('Decision:', decision);
console.log('Reasoning:', decision.reasoning);

// Log relationship changes
const relationships = relationshipManager.processActionImpact(actor, target, action, outcome);
console.log('Relationship changes:', relationships);

// Log consistency results
const assessment = await validator.validateAIConsistency(politician);
console.log('Consistency assessment:', assessment);
```

### Error Handling

The system provides specific error types:

```typescript
try {
  const decision = await decisionEngine.makeDecision(context);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof DecisionEngineError) {
    console.error('Decision error:', error.message, error.politician_id);
  } else if (error instanceof ConsistencyValidationError) {
    console.error('Consistency error:', error.message);
  }
}
```
