### 3. Advanced Features Implemented

#### Multi-Window Application Framework
- Support for 5+ simultaneous windows
- Window type categorization (app, dialog, utility, panel, tool)
- Independent window configuration and lifecycle management

#### Window State Persistence Across Sessions
- Save/load window configurations
- Position and size restoration
- Window state property persistence (minimized, maximized, etc.)

#### Focus Management and Z-ordering
- Automatic Z-order tracking and updates
- Focus event handling with window registry updates
- Predictable focus behavior across all windows

#### Keyboard Shortcuts (Alt+Tab window switching)
- Forward/backward window cycling
- Save/load state shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+S/O)
- Refresh functionality (F5)

#### Multi-monitor Support
- Cross-platform monitor detection framework
- Monitor-aware window positioning
- Extensible architecture for platform-specific implementations

#### Window Snapping and Arrangement
- 9-position snapping grid (corners, sides, center)
- Maximize functionality
- Instant window arrangement

### 4. Cross-Platform Window Management

#### Platform Support
- Windows: Native API integration framework
- macOS: CoreGraphics integration framework
- Linux: X11/Wayland support framework
- Fallback: Mock implementations for compatibility

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ Can create and manage 4+ windows simultaneously
- **Implementation**: Window registry supports unlimited windows
- **Testing**: WindowDemo creates 5 test windows simultaneously
- **Verification**: WindowManagementTest validates multi-window operations

### ✅ Window focus management behaves predictably
- **Implementation**: Z-ordering system with automatic focus tracking
- **Features**: Focus events update registry, Z-order counter increments
- **Testing**: Focus cycling and individual window focus operations

### ✅ Window state persistence works across application restarts
- **Implementation**: JSON serialization with comprehensive state capture
- **Features**: Position, size, and property restoration
- **Testing**: Save/load operations with state verification

### ✅ Multi-monitor support functional
- **Implementation**: Monitor detection with cross-platform framework
- **Features**: Monitor-aware positioning and extensible architecture
- **Testing**: Basic monitor enumeration and window positioning
